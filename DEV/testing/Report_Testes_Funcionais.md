## Test Reporting with Allure-pytest and Netlify.app

In order to perform comprehensive functional tests for each requirement in this folder, we have generated a set of 'reports' using the powerful Allure-pytest tool. These reports offer a detailed and comprehensive overview of the performance and compliance of each requirement. Below, you will find the link that aggregates these reports into a single location. We have utilized the netlify.app application to consolidate and present these reports as a single, user-friendly web page. The goal is to centralize and streamline access to a collection of reports contained in multiple JSON files, providing an effective way to monitor the status and quality of each requirement
